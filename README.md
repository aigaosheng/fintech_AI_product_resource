# User profiling and Taxonomies
User profiling is to develop structued data to characterize the users in your platform, e.g. favorite, activity, behaviors, etc. The field should be human-understandable and explainable, mostly defined at semantic level. A lot of data engineering and data science efforts must be done, e.g. data aggregate, user generated content processing leveraging ML or AI models, et al. It must be tailored to your actual business platform and what user data is collected.
